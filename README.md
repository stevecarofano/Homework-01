# Homework-01

## Description

* I wanted to edit the source code for **Horiseon's** landing page to be more accessible for screen readers, etc.

* You should find many semantic elements in the **HTML** code establishing a semantic flow and making it easier to identify where and what a given element represents, including alternative image text, a cool favicon, and a fixed nav bar to help navigate the page

* It was a challenge to convert all of the div elements to something more descriptive, then track down the relevant selectors in **_CSS_** and edit them so the **HTML** code and **_CSS_** styles could interact properly

* With this in mind, I've learned that it is important and **much** easier to simply include semantic **HTML** elements when initially writing your code so that you don't need to change everything after your site is up and running

* In the future I'd like to implement some forms to contact **Horiseon** and links to more of their services
